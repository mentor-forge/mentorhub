# A006 – Record coordinated cutover, rollback and infrastructure handoff

**Status**: Pending

**Type**: Feature

**Depends On**: A005

**Description**: Remove active AWS dependencies and coordinate GitHub-hosted utils migration — record coordinated cutover, rollback and infrastructure handoff.

**Issue**: [I-WE01](https://github.com/mentor-forge/mentorhub/issues/80)

## Path anchoring

All output paths are relative to this repository root. Sibling references are read-only context permitted by the repo planning guide.

## Context

- `README.md`
- `tasks/_PLANNING.md`
- `tasks/_ORCHESTRATE.md`
- `../mentorhub/DeveloperEdition/standards/ArchitecturePrinciples.md`
- `../mentorhub/DeveloperEdition/standards/sre_standards.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `CHAT_BEST_PRACTICES.md`
- `Workshops/README.md`
- `../mentorhub_api_utils/README.md`
- `../mentorhub_spa_utils/README.md`
- `Specifications/roadmap.yaml`

Source issue is authoritative for this migration. The agreed migration supersedes old CodeArtifact-auth prerequisites only in the paths explicitly migrated by these tasks; do not rewrite unrelated framework rules.

## Goals

- Collect actual GitHub wheel/npm release identifiers, consumer locks, clean local installs, Docker/CI and local auth/registration evidence across in-scope repos. Do not require production provider deployment or migration evidence for local acceptance.
- Confirm core compose and developer tooling work without AWS; validate the limited Admin integration changes against existing local contracts. Verify no speculative cross-cloud framework or provider-specific journey code was added.
- Document rollback to prior package/image pins and local configuration. Keep I-S01 resource inventory, backups, restore evidence and teardown authorization separate from this local release.
- Ensure future AWS provider configuration is anchored in CloudFormation, with possible future provider repos documented only as extension points. Preserve GitHub issue/project states unless separately authorized.

## Testing Expectations

Review all source issue acceptance items against cloud-agnostic local scope. During future execution, make update / mh up all and cross-journey local smoke tests must work without AWS credentials/CLI. No live production cutover, provider selection or AWS deletion is part of this acceptance task.

## Outputs

- `Research/aws_exit_plan.md`
- `Specifications/roadmap.yaml`

Only these implementation files may change. The orchestrator may also update/rename this task record under the established lifecycle.

## Execution boundary

This is a reviewable plan, not an execution record. Execute only this task's listed outputs when orchestration is separately authorized. Do not touch excluded MongoDB/Runbook utility repos, publish packages/tags, mutate issue/project state, or delete/provision AWS resources as a side effect. Future workflow publication happens only through the reviewed maintainer release path.

Where a task requires an unpublished release, unavailable live schema or operator evidence, stop execution at that prerequisite and report it; do not guess values or substitute the unrelated PyPI api-utils package. Pending status describes the plan's review state, not proof that external execution gates are satisfied.

## External prerequisites

Publisher readiness is tracked in https://github.com/mentor-forge/mentorhub_api_utils/issues/36 and https://github.com/mentor-forge/mentorhub_spa_utils/issues/43; AWS inventory/teardown readiness in https://github.com/mentor-forge/mentorhub_cloudformation/issues/12. Track all consumer issues in the source issue checklist. Do not make sibling file changes from this task.

## Cloud-agnostic deployment boundary

The deliverable is a cloud-agnostic **local** deployment plus the agreed GitHub dependency/build migration. Existing identity/hosting implementations are largely placeholders: audit actual executable dependencies before proposing changes. Selecting, implementing or migrating to a production IdP/hosting provider is not a prerequisite for library releases, journey package/build/CI changes or local acceptance.

Keep application-facing backing-service contracts and environment settings provider neutral. Concentrate necessary integration changes in Admin API and DeveloperEdition/docker-compose.yaml where inspection proves coupling; preserve the existing shared JWT/redirect contracts and local persona/mocked-service behavior. Do not create per-journey provider adapters, new identity schemas or a general multi-cloud framework speculatively.

Cloud-specific provisioning, backing-service configuration, identity-provider wiring, roles/secrets and deployment overlays belong to the relevant infrastructure repo: mentorhub_cloudformation owns AWS, including future CodeArtifact provisioning. Future separate repos may implement Google, Microsoft/Azure, IBM or Red Hat platforms against the same contracts; do not create or implement them in this effort. Core compose must not require AWS accounts, credentials or endpoints. A locally optional emulator is not a live AWS dependency; retain it only if useful without making it a required cloud-specific integration.

AWS inventory, secure backup/restore evidence and separately approved decommissioning remain I-S01 responsibilities. Production provider selection or a live production cutover is future infrastructure/integration work, not an acceptance gate for the cloud-agnostic local stack.

## Execution Notes

Reserved for the execution agent. No implementation, tests, service changes or publication have been performed.
